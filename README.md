### This application has been built using server action feature of Nextjs. This approach allows us to execute server-side actions directly from our components, bypassing the need to establish separate API routes.

### For a seamless user experience, optimistic updates is implemented.

### Robust feedback mechanism for form submissions is implemented.

## Disclaimer: server actions are still experimental features in Nextjs and may cause unexpected behavior.

To learn more about server actions, you can check the documentation:

- [Next.js Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions)
